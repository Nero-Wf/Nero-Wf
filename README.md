PostDoc researcher in the field of Chemical and Process Engineering

I’m interested in the automation/optimization of real-world (chemical) processes.
This includes topics like laboratory equipment communication, GUI development, Bayesian optimization, Gaussian Processes, image and particle analysis, and more!

I’m currently learning about the automation of high throughput experimentation!
