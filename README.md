PhD Student in the field of Chemical and Process Engineering from Austria

I’m interested in the automation/optimization of real-world (chemical) processes.
This includes topics like laboratory equipment communication, GUI development, Bayesian optimization, Gaussian Processes, image and particle analysis, and more!

I’m currently learning about image processing, optimimization algorithm benchmarking and deep reinforcement learning
